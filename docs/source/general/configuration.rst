Tedchain Server Configuration
==============================

The configuration of Tedchain server is handled through a JSON file named `config.json`. The file is stored under the ``data`` folder.

It is possible to override a configuration value through environment variables. The name of the variable should be the concatenation of all the components of the path, separated by the character ``:``. For example: ``validator_mode:validator:allow_third_party_assets``.

config.json
-----------

Here is the default file:
   
    {
      "enable_transaction_stream": true,

      "storage": {
        "provider": "SQLite",
        "path": "ledger.db"
      },

      // Define transaction validation parameters
      "validator_mode": {
        // Required: A random string used to generate the chain namespace
        "instance_seed": "",
        "validator": {
          "provider": "PermissionBased",
          // Enable /p2pkh/<address>/ accounts
          "allow_p2pkh_accounts": true,
          // Enable /asset/p2pkh/<address>/ accounts
          "allow_third_party_assets": true,
          // Base-58 addresses that must have admin rights
          "admin_addresses": [
          ],
          "version_byte": 76
        }
      },

      // Uncomment this and comment the "validator_mode" section to enable observer mode
      // "observer_mode": {
      //   "upstream_url": ""
      // },

      "anchoring": {
        "provider": "Blockchain",
        // The key used to publish anchors in the Blockchain
        "key": "",
        "bitcoin_api_url": "https://testnet.api.tedchain.network/v1/",
        "network_byte": 111,
        "fees": 5000,
        "storage": {
          "provider": "SQLite",
          "path": "anchors.db"
        }
      }
    }
    
Root section
------------

* ``enable_transaction_stream``: Boolean indicating whether the transaction stream websocket should be enabled on this instance.

``storage`` section
-------------------

``provider`` defines which storage engine to use. The two built-in values are ``SQLite`` and ``MSSQL``.
    
``SQLite`` storage engine
-------------------------

If the storage provider is set to ``SQLite``, the chain is stored locally using SQLite. In that case, the following setting is used:
    
* ``path``: The path of the Sqlite database, relative to the ``wwwroot/App_Data`` folder. Absolute paths are also allowed, however, make sure the user under which the DNX process is running has write access to the file.

``MSSQL`` storage engine
------------------------

If the storage provider is set to ``MSSQL``, the chain is stored using Microsoft SQL Server. In that case, the following setting is used:

* ``connection_string``: The connection string to the SQL Server database.

Note: Third party storage engines can be build and used by Tedchain. The ``provider`` setting is used to identify at runtime which storage engine should be instantiated.

``validator_mode`` and ``observer_mode`` sections
-------------------------------------------------

These two sections are mutually exclusive. Depending whether the instance is setup in validator mode or observer mode, either the ``validator_mode`` section or ``observer_mode`` section should be present.

In the case of validator mode:

* ``validator_mode:instance_seed``: A random string that should be unique to that instance. It is hashed to obtain a ``namespace`` specific to that instance.
* ``validator_mode:validator:provider``: The type of validation performed by the Tedchain instance when transactions are submitted. The only supported values currently are ``PermissionBased``, ``PermitAll`` and ``DenyAll``.

  * ``PermitAll`` indicates that all transactions are valid, regardless of who signed them. Use this mostly for testing.
  * ``DenyAll`` indicates that all transactions are invalid, regardless of who signed them. Use this to set the chain in read-only mode.
  * See `this section <ledger-rules>` for more details about the implicit rules of the ``PermissionBased`` mode. The relevant configuration settings with the ``PermissionBased`` mode are the following:

    * ``validator_mode:validator:allow_p2pkh_accounts``: Boolean indicating whether `P2PKH accounts <p2pkh-accounts>` (``/p2pkh/<address>/``) are enabled.
    * ``validator_mode:validator:allow_third_party_assets``: Boolean indicating whether `thrid party issuance accounts <third-party-issuance-accounts>` (``/asset/p2pkh/<address>/``) are enabled.
    * ``validator_mode:validator:admin_addresses``: List of strings representing all addresses with admin rights.
    * ``validator_mode:validator:version_byte``: The version byte to use when representing a public key using its Bitcoin address representation.

In the case of observer mode:

* ``observer_mode:upstream_url``: The endpoint URL of the upstream instance to connect to. Transactions will be replicated using this endpoint.

``anchoring`` section
---------------------

This section contains configuration settings relative to publishing an anchor to preserve data integrity.

- ``provider``: Value defining which anchoring mode to use. Currently, the only supported value is ``Blockchain``, and publishes a cumulative hash of the database onto a Bitcoin-compatible blockchain.
- ``key``: The private key to use (in WIF format) as the signing address for the proof of publication transactions.
- ``bitcoin_api_url``: The Tedchain API endpoint to use to list unspent outputs and broadcast the signed transaction. Valid values include:

    - https://api.tedchain.network/v1/ (Bitcoin mainnet)
    - https://testnet.api.tedchain.network/v1/ (Bitcoin testnet)

- ``network_byte``: The network byte corresponding to the network on which the anchor transaction is published.
- ``storage:provider``: Value defining how to cache anchors locally. Currently, the only supported value is ``SQLite`` and caches data locally in a SQLite database.
- ``storage:path``: The path of the local anchor cache database, relative to the ``wwwroot/App_Data`` folder.
